# Q-CTRL Python PyQuil

The aim of the Q-CTRL pyQuil Adapter package is to provide export functions allowing
users to deploy established error-robust quantum control protocols from the
open literature and defined in Q-CTRL Open Controls on Rigetti quantum hardware
and simulators.

Anyone interested in quantum control is welcome to contribute to this project.
